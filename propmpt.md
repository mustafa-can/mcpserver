but my aim is;
1- to create playground test (or whatever best free tool is to use to test, for python, for go, for every programming language and every framework like laravel, nextjs or whatever the client coded in) by invoking client ai agent @test/create. The test must fill all backend and all frontend usage by end user. 

2- to run the test by invoking the client ai @test/run. but if the test was not created, do 1 first and then run the test and write all scenerios results to test.md in client directory. 

i mention that the project is spoken about test is the client project. the client ai agent must understand this. 

prepare me the command
